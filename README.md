# AssignmentRPG_Characters

This is a project that I made as a assignment at Experis Academy. The assignment was to make a console application using Java. In the application you were supposed to be able to create a new hero character that had different attributes depending on what type of hero it was. When you had created a hero you were also supposed to be able to equip different types of armor and weapons that affected your heroÂ´s total attributes. In this project I also performed TDD to be sure that the application had all the functionality that it needed to have and that the methods worked as intended.

The requirements for the assignment:

1. Various character class having attributes which increase at different rates as the character gains levels.

2. Equipment, such as armor and weapons, that characters can equip. The equipped items will alter the power of the character, causing it to deal more damage and be able to survive longer. 
Ceratin characters can equip certain item types.

3. Custom exceptions. There are two cusom exceptions you are required to write.

4. Full test coverage of the functionality.
